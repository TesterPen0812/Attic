# Design system change log

The design system was frozen when the owner signed off the Phase 0 gallery.
Every later change is recorded here: what changed, why, and who asked.

## Phase 1 · Tasks stream (redesign/p1-tasks)

- **Task keys: ⇧Space completes** (`AtticTaskKeys`). ⌥Space still works, but
  launchers (Raycast, ChatGPT) take it on many Macs, so it never reaches Attic
  there. Proposed replacement for the spec's keymap; ⌥Space kept as an alias.
- **Keyboard-only focus rings** (`AtticKeyboardFocus.swift`: the
  `atticKeyboardFocusVisible` environment value and `AtticKeyboardFocusTracker`).
  Owner decision 2026-09-25: rings show only while the keyboard drives (Tab or
  an arrow turns them on, a click turns them off). Task rows and the add bar
  read it. The default is true, so the gallery and captures still draw pinned
  focus states.
- **Task row** (`AtticTaskRow`): `onSelect` (a click selects in Phase 1; the
  row opens its page in Phase 3), `focus` (a list-owned `FocusState<UUID?>`, so
  ↑ ↓ move focus from row to row) and `titleEditing` (Return or a double-click
  edits the title in place: Return saves, Esc cancels, leaving saves). New
  `AtticRowFocus`, `AtticTitleEditing`, `AtticRowTitleEditor`.
- **Quick look** (`AtticQuickLook`): `newSubtask`, an unticked box and the
  title field in place of "Add subtask" while a subtask is being written.
- **Add bar** (`AtticAddBar`): a live init with a run-time placeholder, the
  leading glyph (`magnifyingglass` when the bar searches the Done log),
  `showsSend`, and `tokens`, the new `AtticTokenField`: a native text view that
  draws recognised pieces (#tag, a date, `!`) as chips (a pill in the selection
  fill behind the text as typed, the text in the heading ink: on the raised bar
  the tag's accent grey on the tag fill measured 2.77 : 1 in Dark, and heading
  on the tag fill 4.42 : 1 on Dark Porcelain Glass); Backspace after a chip turns it back into text; ⌘Return, Esc,
  multi-line paste and ⌘Z (typing first, then the page) are reported to the
  owner. Captures draw the same chips with SwiftUI (`AtticChipText`); the
  gallery's add bar board shows them and the Done page's search bar.
- **Selection bar** (`AtticSelectionBar.Action.menu`): a button can open a
  native menu (state, priority, tag) instead of acting.
